        <h2 class="dew"><p>Dynasty begins with heiress Fallon Carrington unhappy to find her <br>billionaire father Blake engaged to Cristal, a rival employee<br> at the family company.<br> When Fallon's machinations to separate the couple backfire and cost her<br> a promotion, 
            she allies with Blake's nemesis and former employee,</p>
             Jeff Colby, and strikes out on her own. Meanwhile, the arrival of Cristal's <br>opportunistic nephew Sam—who becomes romantically involved with <br>Fallon's wayward brother Steven—threatens to expose her shady <br>past. The Carringtons form a unitedfront in the wake of the suspicious <br>death of Cristal's  lover Matthew, but things at the mansion do not remain <br>harmonious for long. Blake's manipulations put him at odds
            with Cristal <br>and his children, while the rivalry between Fallon and Cristal cools.    <a href="https://youtu.be/mxdnWPTALO8">Dynasty </a></h2></p>
